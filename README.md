Introduction

In machine learning, it is important to evaluate the performance of different models on various datasets to determine the most effective one for a given task. In this project, we will implement two datasets, Exp1 and Exp2, using different classification algorithms, including KNN, BPNN, Kernel SVM, Random Forest, Ada boost Random Forest, Ada boost SVM, and XG boost. Additionally, we will analyze the effect of PCA on model performance by comparing the accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve of the models with and without PCA. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify the most accurate and efficient model for each dataset and to gain insights into the impact of PCA on model performance


Abstract

The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including KNN, BPNN, Kernel SVM, Random Forest, Ada boost Random Forest, Ada boost SVM, XG boost, with and without PCA, on two different datasets (Exp1 and Exp2). The accuracy of the models was assessed, and confusion matrices and ROC curves were generated to evaluate the models' performance.
The datasets used in this study were preprocessed and cleaned, and features were selected based on their relevance to the target variable. The selected features were then normalized to ensure that they have the same range and scale.
The models were trained and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves were generated for each algorithm. The results showed that the performance of the models varied depending on the dataset and algorithm used. In general, the XG boost algorithm with PCA outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy and AUC.
The confusion matrices revealed that the models were able to classify the majority of instances correctly, with some misclassification occurring between classes. The ROC curves showed that the models had a good ability to discriminate between the positive and negative instances, with some algorithms performing better than others.
Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of selecting an appropriate algorithm and feature selection technique when applying machine learning models to real-world problems. The results suggest that XG boost with PCA is a promising algorithm for classification tasks on similar datasets.
